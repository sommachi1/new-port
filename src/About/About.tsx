        <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm <strong>Favour Mmesomachi, a frontend developer</strong> with
          a degree in Computer Science and hands-on training from
          <strong>Genesys Tech Academy, Enugu, Nigeria.</strong> I specialize in
          building responsive, user-focused web interfaces using
          <strong>, CSS, JavaScript, Tailand and React.js.</strong> With a
          strong eye for design and attention to detail, I enjoy turning ideas
          into clean, functional code. Iâ€™m passionate about creating great user
          experiences and always eager to learn and grow in a collaborative
          environment.
